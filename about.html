			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><b>For Cops</b></p>
			<p>Our police system is fully co-operative, with bonuses based on the severity of the criminals' crimes, arrest/takedown assists, and bonuses for players who quit or kill themselves after you've been chasing them for a while.</p>
			<p>As a police officer, you also get daily pay based on how many arrests and takedowns you have on your stats.</p>
			<p>Police officers get tazers, free weapons, health, armour, and police vehicles, available at any police station.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><b>For Robbers</b></p>
			<p>Robbers can rob other players, businesses, fast food stores, houses and banks.</p>
			<p>Robbers have lots of missions available to them, such as bus driving, taxi driving, pilot missions, truck+trailer missions, and more.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><b>For Everyone</b></p>
			<p>Be a cop or a robber in Los Santos, San Fierro, or Las Venturas. You can select which city you would like to spawn in.</p>
			<p>Get between and around each city with SACNR's public transport system! Inter-city trains and planes take you clockwise and counter-clockwise around the map respectively, and buses can take you around each city.</p>
			<p>We have an active community with weekly updates behind the scenes.</p>
			<p>You can buy houses and store money and drugs in them. And if you park outside your house and then enter your house and quit, you will respawn in your house with your car outside.</p>
			<p>Businesses can be bought to gain some extra profit. You can sell items at your business, and store lots of money in them. They can also be robbed, so be careful!</p>
